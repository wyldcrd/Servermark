# Servermark 2023 Edition
Originally conceptualized as a plugin,
however due to a lack of coding experience it is a datapack now.

Score is determined by how many zombies have been spawned until the server tps is lower than 16.

Why 16? 

It is considered the minimum playable enjoyable tps.

Why didn't you use X mob?

Because zombies are the first thing I thought of, however if you know how to change variables go ahead.

Future ideas:

Leaderboard

Redstone lag tests

Players instead of entities

More realistic "salad" of entities (adds more variability to testing but makes it more realistic)
