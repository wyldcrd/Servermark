# Servermark 2023 Edition
Originally conceptualized as a plugin,
however due to a lack of coding experience it is a datapack now.

Score is how many zombies are spawned until the server tps is lower than 16

Why 16? 

It is considered the minimum playable enjoyable tps.

Why didn't you use X mob?

Because zombies are the first thing I thought of, however if you know how to change variables go ahead.

Will add a first release tomorrow most likely

Future ideas:

Leaderboard

Redstone lag tests

Players instead of entities
